- Better cache busting logic for data-service I am using a singleton to not repeat api calls.  Maybe a global data store in aurelia ecosystem is a better route
- Is there away to catch errors and redirect to server error (oops page)
- How to use navigation class.active bind attribute to determine active page
- Not the best commenting could have adopted JSDoc syntax
- due to time constraint best practice would be to have wrote unit test
- due to time constraint not all variables are types like public, protected, private and interfaces or types for example for fish api call

- what are generators and tasks in aurelia_project?
- what are some best practice use of aurelia I may be missing in my project
- what is a good source of use for resources configure function in src/resources/index.ts


- Need to understand full the lifecyle events in Aurelia.  I know activate is for before page render and when you return a promise it will suspend next step to lifecyle until finished.
  Attached gets called when view is already rendered
